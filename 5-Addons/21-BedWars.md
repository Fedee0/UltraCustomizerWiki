## BedWars
**By: EazyFTW**
The BedWars addon gives you the ability to add constructors for BedWars1058's events
**NOTE:** This addon requires BedWars1058 to load!

### Constructors
* This addon requires a premium spigot plugin. Because we have temorarily no acces to the plugin we can't provide any element or constructor
