## Setup
Setting up the discord bot addon is very simple. You would need to invite the discord bot to your discord server first.
This can be done by pressing this [HERE](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=813163695881846845&scope=bot&permissions=`)

<br/>

When you invited the bot to your server you would need to get a Authantication code.
To get this code use **!getAuth** in your discord server.

<br/>

This key needs to be used in every element to use the bot. Make sure to keep this Key somewhere you can find it.
