# Server installation
Once you have downloaded the latest version of Ultra Customizer, put its .jar file inside the `plugins` directory of your server.
<br>

**`NOTE:` Make sure to stop the server before doing this.**
<br>

Once the .jar has been uploaded, you can now start your server.
<br>

When your server has been started there should be a new folder called Ultra Customizer. This means that Ultra Customizer has loaded properly and can now be used.
<br>

## Testing the plugin
You should now be able to do **/customizer** to open the GUI!
<br>


**`NOTE:` For proxy installation, please continue to the proxy installation part.**
