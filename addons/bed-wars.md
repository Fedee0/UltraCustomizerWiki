## BedWars
**By: EazyFTW**<br>
The BedWars addon gives you the ability to add constructors for BedWars1058's events.
<br>


### Constructors
* This addon requires a premium spigot plugin. Because we have temporarily no acces to the plugin we can't provide any element or constructor
<br>

`Note:` *This addon requires [BedWars1058](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bedwars1058-opensource.97320/) to load!*
