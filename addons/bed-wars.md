## BedWars
**By: EazyFTW**
The BedWars addon gives you the ability to add constructors for BedWars1058's events
<br>

**`NOTE:` This addon requires BedWars1058 to load!**
<br>

### Constructors
* This addon requires a premium spigot plugin. Because we have temporarily no acces to the plugin we can't provide any element or constructor
