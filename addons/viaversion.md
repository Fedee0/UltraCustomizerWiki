## ViaVersion
**By: Fedee**
The ViaVersion addon allows you to get the protocol number of the version the player is using.
<br>

### Elements
* **Get Protocol Number** - *Get the protocol number with which the player entered the server.*
* **Get Player Version** - *Get the client version with which the player joined the server.*
<br>

**Example:** If the player joined with the version 1.8 the protocol number will be 47, you can find a list of all the protocol numbers for each version **[HERE](https://wiki.vg/Protocol_version_numbers)**.
<br>

`Note:` *This addon requires [ViaVersion](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viaversion.19254/) to load! For the addon to work properly, it is necessary that **ViaVersion** is installed only on the **proxy** or only on the **back-end** servers.*
